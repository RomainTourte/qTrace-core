/**
 * Immutable snapshot of QuPath's built-in "Brightness & contrast" dialog
 * (View > Brightness/contrast — {@code qupath.lib.display.ImageDisplay}) at the moment
 * it was closed.
 *
 * Unlike {@link MeasurementMapRecord}, this one <b>is</b> replayable: every field maps onto
 * a public {@code ImageDisplay}/{@code QuPathViewer} scripting call
 * ({@code setMinMaxDisplay}, {@code setChannelSelected}, {@code setLUTColor}, {@code setGamma}),
 * so {@code QTraceReplayEngine} turns each captured record into a real, executable step — this
 * is what makes the final figure's appearance reproducible, not just the underlying pixel data.
 *
 * Created by ActionLogger.snapshotDisplaySettingsState(); consumed by QTraceExporter.
